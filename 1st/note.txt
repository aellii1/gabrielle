I just want to tell you how I'm so grateful to have you
in my life— To actually have you as my Girlfriend. 
I love you for who you are and whatever you are. 
You're the one and only woman in my heart and no one
could replace that. 

A lot have happened to us for the past 5 months.
joy, excitement, misunderstanding, and etc.
with all that we've been through, yet here we are, 
choosing and still loving each other. we may misunderstood each other
or rather I misunderstood you a lot, I'd still want to listen to 
you and try to see things from your perspective— you're still the person 
I want to grow with; you're my home.

Anyway, Thank you for everything. thank you for still choosing and loving me. 
I couldn't write and express a lot in this page on how I love you.
to end this letter, HAPPY MONTHSARRY, MY LOVE! I LOVE YOU AND ALWAYS WILL!
